/*When the scheduler is called to dispatch the next process, it checks if the ready queue is empty. If so, it has three possibilities: if there are no processes that need to be completed, the processor enter an halt state; if there are still processes to be completed that are waiting on a semaphore queue the processor enter a wait state and wait for a process to be unblocked, after enabling the interrupts and "disabling" the PLT (by setting a high value) as the wait state must not be released by a timer interrupt; at last, a deadlock situation is  defined when there are still non terminated process but none of them is waiting for an I/O.
If there is a process in the ready queue, the scheduler dispatches it by storing his pointer in the current process field, loading the timer and loading the processor state.
